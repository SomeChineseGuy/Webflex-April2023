## Primary Key PK

- uniquely indentifying an item in the DB!

## Naming conventions

Every company does it differently
In LHL id user_id
in the users table, we name the PK as just ID
Other companies they could name their ids are "name of table"\_id
snake_case this_is_my_name this-is-my-name

## Data Types

Name TEXT
Name varchar 355

## Relationship (types)
